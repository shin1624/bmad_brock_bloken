## Dev Notes
### GitHub Actions Workflow Structure
```yaml
name: Deploy to Production
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: npm run typecheck
      - run: npm run test:run
      - run: npx playwright install --with-deps
      - run: npm run test:e2e

  build-and-deploy:
    needs: test
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      # Add deployment step based on platform
```

### Deployment Platform Options
1. **GitHub Pages** (Static hosting)
   - Free for public repos
   - Use `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3`
   - Deploy to `gh-pages` branch

2. **Vercel** (Recommended for React apps)
   - Automatic preview deployments
   - Use Vercel CLI or GitHub integration
   - Environment variables via Vercel dashboard

3. **Netlify**
   - Similar to Vercel
   - Use Netlify CLI or GitHub integration
   - Form handling and functions support

### Environment Variables
```env
# Production environment
VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com
VITE_ANALYTICS_ID=UA-XXXXXXXX
VITE_ENVIRONMENT=production
```

### Required Secrets
- `DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN`: Platform-specific deployment token
- `NOTIFICATION_WEBHOOK`: Slack/Discord webhook for notifications

### Build Optimization
- Enable source maps for production debugging
- Implement code splitting for better performance
- Use Vite's built-in optimization features
- Consider CDN for static assets

### Rollback Procedure
1. Identify the last working deployment commit
2. Revert to previous commit: `git revert HEAD`
3. Push to main to trigger deployment
4. Alternative: Use platform-specific rollback features

## Testing
### Workflow Testing
- Test workflow syntax with `act` tool locally
- Verify all steps pass in PR before merging
- Test deployment to staging environment first
- Validate build artifacts are correctly generated

### Monitoring
- GitHub Actions dashboard for workflow status
- Platform-specific deployment logs
- Application monitoring (Sentry, LogRocket)
- Performance monitoring post-deployment

## QA Results

### QA Assessment Date: 2025-01-29
**Reviewer**: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Risk Assessment Summary
- **Total Risks Identified**: 12
- **Highest Risk**: SEC-001 (Score: 9) - Exposed secrets in workflow files
- **Risk Score**: 45/100 (High Risk Level)
- **Critical Risks**: 2
- **High Risks**: 3

**Risk Profile**: `docs/qa/assessments/8.2-deployment-pipeline-risk-20250129.md`

### Test Design Summary
- **Total Test Scenarios**: 36
- **Test Distribution**:
  - Unit Tests: 15 (42%)
  - Integration Tests: 13 (36%)
  - E2E Tests: 8 (22%)
- **Priority Distribution**:
  - P0 (Critical): 12
  - P1 (High): 15
  - P2 (Medium): 9
- **Coverage**: 100% of acceptance criteria covered
- **Risk Mitigation**: 100% of critical/high risks have corresponding tests

**Test Design**: `docs/qa/assessments/8.2-deployment-pipeline-test-design-20250129.md`

### Key Recommendations

#### Must Fix Before Implementation
1. **Security**: Use GitHub Secrets for all sensitive values - never hardcode (SEC-001)
2. **Operations**: Implement mandatory test gates before deployment (OPS-001)
3. **Technical**: Validate workflow syntax with tools before commit (TECH-001)

#### Should Monitor During Development
1. **Performance**: Implement aggressive caching to prevent build degradation (PERF-001)
2. **Data**: Configure artifact retention policies (DATA-001)
3. **Security**: Enable branch protection rules on main branch (SEC-002)
4. **Operations**: Test notification webhooks thoroughly (OPS-002)

#### Testing Priorities
1. **P0 Tests First**: Focus on security (secrets management) and deployment gates
2. **Workflow Validation**: Use 'act' tool for local testing before pushing
3. **Integration Focus**: Verify all CI/CD components work together
4. **E2E Validation**: Complete deployment cycle with rollback testing

### Quality Gate Recommendation
**Status**: CONCERNS

**Rationale**: While the story is well-structured with comprehensive acceptance criteria, the presence of 2 critical security and operational risks (SEC-001, OPS-001) requires immediate attention. These risks could lead to production security breaches or broken deployments. The story should proceed with implementation but must address the critical risks before deployment to production.

### Additional Notes
- Consider using GitHub Environments for deployment approval workflows
- Implement secret scanning as part of the CI pipeline (e.g., TruffleHog, GitLeaks)
- Document the deployment rollback procedure thoroughly with step-by-step instructions
- Set up cost monitoring alerts if using paid GitHub Actions minutes
- Consider implementing progressive deployment strategies (canary, blue-green)

### Implementation Review Date: 2025-01-29
**Reviewer**: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Gate Status
Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/8.2-deployment-pipeline.yml

**Gate Decision Date**: 2025-01-29
**Final Assessment**: Story implementation successfully addresses all critical security and operational requirements. The CI/CD pipeline is properly configured with:
- ✅ SEC-001 fully mitigated: All secrets use GitHub Secrets
- ✅ OPS-001 fully mitigated: Mandatory test gates implemented
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation for deployment and rollback
- ✅ Multi-stage pipeline with proper separation of concerns
- ✅ Performance optimization through caching strategies

**Minor Note**: Existing project-wide lint errors are present but these are not new issues introduced by this story. Recommend addressing in a separate technical debt story.

**Deployment Readiness**: The pipeline is production-ready. Team should configure GitHub Secrets and branch protection rules before first deployment.

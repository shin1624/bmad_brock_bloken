# Story 4.2: 基本パワーアップ実装

**Epic**: 4. パワーアップシステム  
**Status**: Done
**Story Statement**: "As a プレイヤー I want 様々なパワーアップ So that 戦略的なプレイができる"  
**Created Date**: 2025-01-18  
**Assigned To**: Dev Agent  

## Story Context

Epic 4 focuses on implementing a comprehensive power-up system that adds strategic depth to the gameplay. Story 4.2 builds upon the foundational infrastructure established in Story 4.1 by implementing the actual power-ups that players will interact with during gameplay. This includes the MVP set of power-ups that provide core gameplay variations: multi-ball, paddle size changes, and ball speed modifications.

## Acceptance Criteria

From Epic 4.2 requirements:
- [x] **AC1**: マルチボール（3個同時） - Multi-ball implementation (3 balls simultaneously)
- [x] **AC2**: パドルサイズ変更（大/小） - Paddle size modification (large/small)  
- [x] **AC3**: ボール速度変更（速/遅） - Ball speed modification (fast/slow)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: docs/stories/4.1.power-up-foundation.md Dev Agent Record]
- Successfully implemented power-up foundation with plugin architecture
- Established PowerUp entity class, PluginManager, and PowerUpSystem
- Created visual indicators integration with HUD components
- Implemented effect stacking management and duration tracking
- Pattern of comprehensive test coverage established

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/5-コア設計パターン.md#5.3 プラグインアーキテクチャ]
- **PowerUp Registration**: Each power-up must be registered through `game.powerUpManager.register()`
- **Effect Interface**: `{ type: string, effect: (game: GameEngine) => void, duration: number }`
- **Plugin Structure**: Implement as Plugin with `name`, `version`, `init()`, `destroy()` methods
- **Effect Stacking**: Use existing stacking rules from PowerUpSystem

[Source: architecture/4-プロジェクト構造.md]
- **Ball Entity**: Located at `src/game/entities/Ball.ts`
- **Paddle Entity**: Located at `src/game/entities/Paddle.ts`
- **Game State**: Managed in `src/game/core/GameState.ts`

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/4-プロジェクト構造.md]
- **File Locations**:
  - `src/game/plugins/powerups/MultiBallPowerUp.ts` - Multi-ball power-up plugin
  - `src/game/plugins/powerups/PaddleSizePowerUp.ts` - Paddle size power-up plugin
  - `src/game/plugins/powerups/BallSpeedPowerUp.ts` - Ball speed power-up plugin
  - `src/game/systems/PowerUpSystem.ts` - Existing system to extend
  - `src/game/entities/Ball.ts` - Ball entity to modify for multi-ball
  - `src/game/entities/Paddle.ts` - Paddle entity to modify for size changes

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/5-コア設計パターン.md]
- **Power-Up Effect Application**: Effects are applied through `applyEffect(game: GameEngine)` method
- **Duration Management**: Handled by PowerUpSystem with automatic cleanup after duration expires
- **State Management**: Game state tracks active power-ups in `activePowerUps` array

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/10-テスト戦略.md]
- Unit tests for each power-up plugin (60% coverage minimum)
- Integration tests for power-up application and removal
- Test effect stacking (e.g., multiple speed modifiers)
- Test edge cases (e.g., ball limit for multi-ball, minimum paddle size)
- Performance testing to ensure 60 FPS maintained with active power-ups

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/2-技術スタック詳細.md]
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Must maintain 60 FPS performance target
- Memory usage under 200MB even with multiple active power-ups
- Canvas 2D API for rendering additional balls
- Use object pooling for multi-ball to avoid memory issues

### Project Structure Notes
- Power-up plugins follow the established plugin pattern from Story 4.1
- Each power-up is a separate plugin file in `src/game/plugins/powerups/` directory
- Visual effects integrate with existing ParticleSystem
- Audio feedback uses existing AudioSystem

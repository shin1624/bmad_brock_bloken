Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** QA Engineer,
**I want** complete E2E test coverage for all UI buttons,
**so that** we can ensure all interactive elements work correctly across browsers

## Acceptance Criteria

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Story 7.4 successfully resolved TypeScript errors and improved test infrastructure. The E2E test foundation is solid, but button coverage gaps were identified by Quinn (QA) in the test execution report.

### Current Test Coverage Status
From Story 7.2 E2E implementation and recent test runs:
- Basic navigation buttons: 60% coverage (Start Game, Settings, High Scores tested)
- Settings modal controls: 0% coverage
- Level Editor buttons: 0% coverage
- About modal: 0% coverage

### File Locations
Based on existing project structure:
- Page Objects: `e2e/pages/*.page.ts`
- Test Specs: `e2e/tests/*.spec.ts`
- Fixtures: `e2e/fixtures/*.ts`
- Test Helpers: `e2e/fixtures/canvas-helpers.ts`

### Selector Patterns
Current UI implementation uses:
- Main buttons: `aria-label` attributes (e.g., `button[aria-label="Start new game"]`)
- Modals: `data-testid` attributes (e.g., `[data-testid="settings-modal"]`)
- Form controls: `aria-label` for inputs and selects

### Known Issues to Address
From test execution report (docs/qa/reports/e2e-test-report-2025-09-27.md):
1. Selector mismatches: "Play Game" vs "Start new game"
2. LocalStorage access errors in certain test contexts
3. Missing Page Object Models for Level Editor and About modal

### Testing Standards
- **Framework**: Playwright with TypeScript
- **Pattern**: Page Object Model for maintainability
- **Test Location**: `e2e/tests/button-coverage.spec.ts` (new file)
- **Assertions**: Use Playwright's built-in expect assertions
- **Timeouts**: Default 10s for actions, 5s for assertions
- **Parallelization**: Tests should be independent and parallelizable
- **Naming**: Descriptive test names following "should [action] when [condition]" pattern

### Performance Requirements
- Individual button test: < 5 seconds
- Full button suite: < 2 minutes
- Parallel execution with 4 workers maximum

## Testing
- All tests must follow Page Object Model pattern
- Each test must be atomic and independent
- Use `beforeEach` for common setup (navigation to main menu)
- Include proper cleanup in `afterEach` if needed
- Test files must pass ESLint and TypeScript checks
- Coverage report should show 100% button interaction coverage

- **Traceability Document**: `docs/qa/assessments/7.5-requirements-traceability-2025-09-27.md`

### Non-Functional Requirements Assessment
- **Performance**: ✅ All targets met (<5s per test, <2min suite)
- **Reliability**: ✅ Retry logic, wait conditions, error handling implemented
- **Maintainability**: ✅ Page Object Model, flexible selectors, test fixtures
- **Cross-Browser**: ✅ Chrome, Firefox, Safari validated

### Quality Gate Decision: ✅ PASS
**Gate File**: `docs/qa/gates/7.5-button-test-coverage.yml`

**Rationale**: Story demonstrates exceptional test implementation with:
- Complete requirements coverage for existing features
- Robust test architecture with reliability features
- Cross-browser validation complete
- Performance requirements exceeded

**Risk Assessment**:
- Technical Risk: LOW
- Coverage Risk: LOW (100% of existing features tested)
- Maintenance Risk: LOW
- Production Readiness: HIGH

### Recommendations
**Immediate**: None - Ready for production

**Future Enhancements**:
1. Implement About button for 100% specification compliance
2. Align Level Editor/Select terminology with product requirements
3. Consider visual regression tests for button states

### Technical Debt
- **Identified**: UI implementation differs from specification
- **Severity**: LOW
- **Quantified**: ~2 story points
- **Impact**: Minor user confusion possible

### Compliance Status
- Testing Standards: MEETS ✅

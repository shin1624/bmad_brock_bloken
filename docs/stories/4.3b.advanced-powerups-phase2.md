**Epic**: 4. パワーアップシステム  
**Status**: Approval Pending - Blocked by Prerequisites (See Blockers section)
**Story Statement**: "As a プレイヤー I want 時間操作と攻撃的パワーアップ So that アクティブな戦術オプションが増える"  
**Created Date**: 2025-01-29  
**Assigned To**: Dev Agent  
**PO Review Date**: 2025-01-08  

## Story Context

Epic 4 focuses on implementing a comprehensive power-up system. Story 4.3b (Phase 2) implements the more complex advanced power-ups that require additional systems: Slow Motion and Laser Gun. This story depends on the completion of 4.3a and requires the new ProjectileSystem design.

**Prerequisites:**
- Story 4.3a must be completed first
- ProjectileSystem design document must be approved
- Performance benchmarking environment must be established

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: PowerUpSystem, PowerUpPlugin base class, PowerUpRegistry
- New system required: ProjectileSystem for laser functionality
- Technology: TypeScript, Canvas API, Plugin Architecture
- Touch points: Game loop timing, collision system expansion

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. **AC1**: スローモーション実装 - Game time slows to 50% speed for 10 seconds (paddle remains normal speed)
2. **AC2**: レーザー発射実装 - Shoot projectiles from paddle edges at 2 shots per second for 20 seconds
3. **AC3**: ProjectileSystem実装 - New system manages laser projectiles with object pooling

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Each power-up follows existing PowerUpPlugin pattern
5. Power-ups registered through PowerUpRegistry
6. Visual indicators integrated with HUD PowerUpStatus component  
7. All Phase 1 power-ups (Shield, Pierce, Magnet) remain fully functional
8. Existing basic power-ups continue to work unchanged

**Quality Requirements:**
9. Unit tests achieve 90% coverage for each new component
10. Integration tests for critical combinations:
    - Slow Motion + Multi-ball (high risk)
    - Laser + Multi-ball (high risk)
    - Slow Motion + Laser
    - All 5 advanced power-ups active
11. Visual feedback distinct and non-interfering
12. Performance maintains 55 FPS with any 3 power-ups active
13. Performance maintains 50 FPS with all 5 advanced power-ups active
14. Memory usage stays under 250MB during gameplay

**Interaction Rules:**
15. Power-up priority order: Shield > Slow Motion > Magnet > Laser > Pierce
16. Time-based effects (Slow Motion) affect all entities except paddle
17. Projectile system operates independently of ball physics

## Technical Notes

### ProjectileSystem Requirements

**Core Functionality:**
- Object pooling for projectiles (pool size: 20)
- Collision detection with blocks only (not balls or paddle)
- Projectile speed: 500 pixels/second
- Projectile size: 4x12 pixels
- Automatic cleanup of off-screen projectiles

**Integration Points:**
- Register with game update loop
- Share collision detection with existing system
- Render layer between balls and particles

### Power-Up Interaction Matrix (Phase 2)

| Power-Up A | Power-Up B | Interaction | Risk Level |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Slow Motion | Multi-ball | All balls slow, paddle normal | HIGH |
| Slow Motion | Shield | Shield timing unaffected | LOW |
| Slow Motion | Pierce | Pierce duration in real-time | MEDIUM |
| Slow Motion | Magnet | Release timing preserved | LOW |
| Slow Motion | Laser | Fire rate in game-time | MEDIUM |
| Laser | Multi-ball | Laser independent of balls | HIGH |
| Laser | Shield | Both work independently | LOW |
| Laser | Pierce | No interaction | LOW |
| Laser | Magnet | Can fire while holding | MEDIUM |

### Implementation Details

**Slow Motion Power-Up:**
- File: `src/game/plugins/powerups/SlowMotionPowerUp.ts`
- GameState: Add `timeScale: number` (default 1.0, slow = 0.5)
- Visual: Time distortion overlay (wavy screen edge effect)
- Implementation: Modify deltaTime in game loop for all except paddle
- Duration: 10 seconds real-time
- Transition: Smooth scale change over 0.5 seconds

**Laser Gun Power-Up:**
- File: `src/game/plugins/powerups/LaserGunPowerUp.ts`
- System: `src/game/systems/ProjectileSystem.ts`
- GameState: Add `laserActive: boolean`
- Visual: Red laser beams from paddle edges
- Fire rate: 2 shots/second (500ms interval)
- Damage: Instant block destruction
- Duration: 20 seconds
- Audio cue: "pew" sound at 0.3 volume

### Performance Optimizations Required

1. **Effect Pooling:** Reuse visual effect objects
2. **Render Batching:** Group similar renders
3. **Conditional Updates:** Skip inactive systems
4. **Quality Settings:** Add low/medium/high quality options

## Definition of Done

- **Estimated Time**: 0.5-1 day
- **Why Critical**: Cannot validate 55/50 FPS and 250MB requirements
- **Action**: Integrate Chrome DevTools → Create FPS counter → Setup memory profiling

#### Recommended Workflow

**Phase 1: Blocker Resolution (Start Immediately)**
```
Priority 1: ProjectileSystem Design
  └─ Assign to Architect
  └─ Timeline: 1-2 days
  └─ Deliverable: Design doc + prototype validation

Priority 2: Story 4.3a Completion (Parallel Track)
  └─ Fix Vitest migration
  └─ Execute test suite
  └─ Timeline: 1 day

Priority 3: Performance Infrastructure (Parallel Track)
  └─ Build FPS measurement tools
  └─ Setup memory profiling
  └─ Timeline: 0.5-1 day
```

**Phase 2: Re-Review & Approval (After Blockers Resolved)**
```
All blockers cleared
  ↓
PO re-review
  ↓
Full approval granted
  ↓
Development can begin
```

#### Estimated Timeline

- **Blocker Resolution**: 2-3 days (with parallel work)
- **Re-review**: 0.5 day
- **Total to Approval**: ~3 days

#### Risk Assessment Alignment

PO agrees with QA assessment:
- ✅ Risk score 44/100 (HIGH RISK) is accurate
- ✅ Critical risks (TECH-001, PERF-001) justify blockers
- ✅ 42 test scenarios provide adequate coverage
- ✅ Performance targets (55/50 FPS) are appropriate

#### PO Decision Rationale

**Why PENDING vs APPROVED**:
1. ProjectileSystem is entirely new - design mistakes are expensive
2. Phase 2 depends on Phase 1 stability
3. Performance requirements cannot be validated without tools
4. Starting development without blockers resolved = wasted effort

**Why PENDING vs REJECTED**:
1. Story quality is excellent
2. Requirements are clear and testable
3. Blockers are external dependencies, not story defects
4. All blockers are resolvable within reasonable timeframe

#### Next Steps for Team

**Immediate Actions**:
1. 🎯 **Architect**: Create ProjectileSystem design document
2. 🎯 **Dev Team**: Complete Story 4.3a (Vitest migration)
3. 🎯 **Dev Team**: Build performance benchmark infrastructure

**Notification**:
- PO will re-review once all 3 blockers are marked complete
- Expected approval within 1 day after blockers cleared

**Do NOT**:
- ❌ Start Story 4.3b development
- ❌ Create Story 4.3b development tasks
- ❌ Assign Story 4.3b to sprint

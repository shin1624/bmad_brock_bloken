### Common Patterns Established
```typescript
// Test structure pattern
describe('Component', () => {
  describe('Feature Category', () => {
    it('should specific behavior', () => {
      // Arrange
      const setup = createTestSetup();
      
      // Act
      const result = performAction();
      
      // Assert
      expect(result).toMatchExpectation();
    });
  });
});

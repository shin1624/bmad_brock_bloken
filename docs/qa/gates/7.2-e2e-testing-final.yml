decision_rationale: |
  Story 7.2 has successfully implemented a comprehensive E2E testing infrastructure
  that exceeds the acceptance criteria. The implementation includes not only the
  required Playwright setup and core gameplay tests, but also extends to visual
  regression, performance monitoring, and accessibility compliance testing.
  
  The CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions and automated reporting demonstrates
  production readiness. While minor optimization opportunities exist, they do not
  impact the core functionality or quality of the testing infrastructure.
  
  All critical risks have been addressed, and the implementation follows best
  practices with Page Object Model pattern and proper test organization.

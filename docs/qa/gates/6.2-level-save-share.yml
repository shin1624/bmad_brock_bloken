  summary: |
    Story 6.2 has successfully implemented all acceptance criteria with comprehensive
    test coverage (94%) and robust security measures. Minor concerns exist around
    edge case validation testing and UI integration tests, but these present low risk
    and can be addressed post-deployment.

gate_rationale: |
  The implementation demonstrates solid engineering practices with comprehensive
  test coverage, proper error handling, and security measures. The identified
  gaps are minor and present low risk to production deployment. The 3-tier
  storage fallback strategy provides excellent resilience, and the use of
  industry-standard libraries (pako, zod, DOMPurify) ensures reliability.
  
  The 94% test coverage exceeds organizational standards, and all critical
  paths are well-tested. The missing edge cases and UI integration tests
  can be addressed iteratively without blocking deployment.

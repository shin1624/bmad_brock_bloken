  status: "Draft"

gate_decision: CONCERNS

gate_score: 72/100

rationale: |
  Story 7.2 demonstrates strong E2E testing design with comprehensive coverage of critical paths.
  However, two critical risks (Canvas testing complexity and test execution time) require 
  immediate mitigation strategies before proceeding to implementation. The test design is solid
  with 42 well-structured scenarios covering all acceptance criteria.

  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Implement Canvas testing utility library before test development"
      - "Set up parallel execution infrastructure to meet <10min target"
      - "Create robust wait strategies for animation timing"
    monitor:
      - "Track test execution times per scenario"
      - "Monitor flaky test rate during implementation"
      - "Watch for visual regression baseline drift"

    - "Good performance validation"

coverage_assessment:
  acceptance_criteria: 100%  # All 7 ACs covered
  risk_mitigation: 83%       # 10/12 risks addressed
  critical_paths: 100%       # All user journeys tested
  browser_support: 100%      # Chrome, Firefox, Safari covered
  performance_tests: "Strong" # FPS, load time, memory covered

quality_attributes:
  testability: "High - Good Page Object Model design"
  maintainability: "Medium - Visual regression requires ongoing updates"
  reliability: "Medium - Canvas testing may be flaky initially"
  performance: "Concern - Test suite may exceed 10min limit"
  security: "Weak - Limited security test coverage"

recommendations:
  immediate_actions:
    - "Create Canvas testing utility library with coordinate helpers"
    - "Implement test parallelization strategy"
    - "Set up visual regression baseline management process"
    - "Configure browser-specific test runners"
  
  before_implementation:
    - "Pilot test Canvas interactions to validate approach"
    - "Benchmark test execution times"
    - "Establish flaky test monitoring"
  
  during_implementation:
    - "Start with P0 scenarios (18 tests)"
    - "Implement tiered test suites (smoke, regression, full)"
    - "Add retry mechanisms for known flaky areas"
  
  nice_to_have:
    - "Add security test suite separately"
    - "Implement network resilience tests"
    - "Create performance profiling tests"

conditions_for_pass:
  - "Canvas testing utilities implemented and validated"
  - "Parallel execution demonstrates <10min for P0 tests"
  - "Pilot tests show <1% flaky rate"
  - "Visual regression baseline process documented"

technical_debt_identified:
  - "Missing security test infrastructure"
  - "No network simulation capabilities"
  - "Limited animation testing tools"

estimated_effort:
  setup: "3-4 days"
  implementation: "8-10 days"
  stabilization: "2-3 days"
  total: "13-17 days"

approval_notes: |
  Story 7.2 shows excellent test design and planning. The CONCERNS rating is primarily
  due to the technical challenges of Canvas testing and performance requirements.
  With proper mitigation of the identified critical risks, this story can proceed
  to implementation. Focus on building robust testing utilities first.

**Project**: BMAD Brock Bloken

## Overview
This document tracks technical debt items identified during development and their remediation status.

## Active Debt Items

### TD-001: TypeScript Lint Errors
- **Issue**: TypeScript lint errors across the codebase
- **Impact**: Code quality, maintainability, potential runtime errors
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: In Progress (Phase 3 completed, 126 errors remaining)
- **Progress**: 
  - Phase 1: ‚úÖ Reduced from 329 to 255 errors
  - Phase 2: ‚úÖ Reduced from 255 to 227 errors
  - Phase 3: ‚úÖ Reduced from 227 to 126 errors (62% total reduction)
  - Phase 4: üîÑ Target: Zero errors (manual review required)
- **Remaining Work**:
  - 72 unused variable errors (need review and cleanup)
  - 39 any type errors (require manual type definitions)
  - 4 ban-ts-comment errors (review for proper fixes)
  - 11 other errors
- **Automation Created**:
  - `scripts/fix-all-lint-errors.mjs`
  - `scripts/fix-unused-vars.mjs`
  - `scripts/fix-test-lint-errors.mjs`
  - `scripts/fix-remaining-any-errors.mjs`

### TD-002: Test Coverage Gaps
- **Issue**: Some critical components lack comprehensive test coverage
- **Impact**: Risk of undetected bugs, regression issues
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Areas Needing Coverage**:
  - Level Editor components
  - Theme switching logic
  - Sound system integration
  - Performance monitoring

### TD-003: Performance Optimizations
- **Issue**: Canvas rendering not fully optimized
- **Impact**: Potential frame drops on lower-end devices
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Optimizations Needed**:
  - Implement render batching
  - Add frustum culling
  - Optimize particle systems
  - Implement object pooling for all entities

### TD-004: Documentation Gaps
- **Issue**: Some complex systems lack adequate documentation
- **Impact**: Onboarding difficulty, maintenance challenges
- **Priority**: Low
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Areas Needing Documentation**:
  - Plugin architecture
  - Power-up system
  - Custom hooks
  - State management patterns

## Resolved Debt Items

*No items resolved yet*

## Debt Prevention Measures

### Implemented
- ESLint configuration with strict rules
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Prettier for consistent formatting
- Automated lint fixing scripts

### Planned
- Pre-commit hooks for lint checking
- CI/CD pipeline with quality gates
- Automated test coverage reporting
- Performance monitoring in production

## Metrics

| Category | Current | Target | Status |
|----------|---------|---------|--------|
| Lint Errors | 126 | 0 | üîÑ In Progress |
| Test Coverage | ~70% | 90% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Below Target |
| Performance (FPS) | 55-60 | 60 | ‚úÖ Meeting Target |
| Bundle Size | TBD | <500KB | üìä Not Measured |

## Notes

- Lint cleanup has been the primary focus, with 62% reduction achieved
- Automated scripts created for future maintenance
- Manual review required for remaining complex type issues
- Consider implementing stricter code review process to prevent new debt

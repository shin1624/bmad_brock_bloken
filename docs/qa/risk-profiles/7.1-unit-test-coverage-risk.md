## Detailed Risk Analysis

### 1. Critical Risks (Score 7-9)

#### Canvas API Mocking Complexity
- **Score**: 9/9 (High Impact × High Probability)
- **Description**: Browser Canvas API is complex to mock accurately for unit tests
- **Impact**: 
  - Tests may not run in Node.js environment
  - False positives/negatives in rendering tests
  - Increased test complexity
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Create `CanvasMockFactory` abstraction layer
  - Use `jsdom-canvas` or `node-canvas` libraries
  - Isolate rendering logic from game logic
- **Residual Risk**: Low after mitigation
- **Owner**: Dev team lead
- **Timeline**: Task 1.5 (Day 1-2)

### 2. High Risks (Score 5-6)

#### Test Execution Time
- **Score**: 6/9 (Medium Impact × High Probability)
- **Description**: 78 existing tests + new tests may exceed CI/CD time limits
- **Impact**:
  - Slow feedback loop for developers
  - CI/CD pipeline bottlenecks
  - Developer productivity loss
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Implement test sharding across workers
  - Separate fast/slow test suites
  - Optimize test setup/teardown
  - Use test.concurrent for independent tests
- **Residual Risk**: Low after optimization
- **Owner**: DevOps team
- **Timeline**: Task 1.2 (Day 1)

#### Async Test Flakiness
- **Score**: 6/9 (High Impact × Medium Probability)
- **Description**: Game loop and animation tests prone to timing issues
- **Impact**:
  - Random test failures
  - Loss of confidence in test suite
  - Wasted debugging time
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Use vi.useFakeTimers() consistently
  - Implement proper async/await patterns
  - Create `waitForGameState()` utility
  - Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Residual Risk**: Very low with proper patterns
- **Owner**: Senior developers
- **Timeline**: Task 2.1 (Day 3-4)

#### Coverage vs Quality Trade-off
- **Score**: 6/9 (High Impact × Medium Probability)
- **Description**: Pressure to reach 90% may lead to low-quality tests
- **Impact**:
  - False sense of security
  - Tests that don't catch real bugs
  - Technical debt accumulation
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Implement mutation testing
  - Code review all test PRs
  - Focus on behavior, not lines
  - Track test quality metrics
- **Residual Risk**: Medium (requires ongoing vigilance)
- **Owner**: QA team
- **Timeline**: Continuous

### 3. Medium Risks (Score 3-4)

#### Developer Expertise Gap
- **Score**: 4/9 (Medium Impact × Medium Probability)
- **Description**: Team may lack Vitest/Canvas testing experience
- **Impact**:
  - Slower implementation
  - Suboptimal test patterns
  - Knowledge silos
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Conduct Vitest workshop
  - Create test pattern documentation
  - Pair programming sessions
  - Code review emphasis on learning
- **Residual Risk**: Low after training
- **Owner**: Tech lead
- **Timeline**: Week 1

### 4. Low Risks (Score 1-2)

#### CI/CD Integration Issues
- **Score**: 3/9 (High Impact × Low Probability)
- **Description**: Test suite may not integrate smoothly with CI/CD
- **Impact**:
  - Deployment delays
  - Manual intervention required
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Early CI/CD integration testing

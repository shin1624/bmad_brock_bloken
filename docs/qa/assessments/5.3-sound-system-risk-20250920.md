- Risk Score: 67/100 (Moderate Risk)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

*No critical risks identified*

## High Risks Requiring Mitigation

### 1. TECH-001: Web Audio API Browser Compatibility
**Score: 6 (High)**  
**Probability**: Medium - Older browsers and some mobile browsers have limited support  
**Impact**: High - Core audio functionality completely unavailable  
**Mitigation**:
- Implement feature detection with graceful degradation
- Provide polyfills where possible
- Add clear browser requirements in documentation
- Show user-friendly message for unsupported browsers
**Testing Focus**: Cross-browser compatibility testing matrix

### 2. PERF-001: Audio Processing CPU Impact
**Score: 6 (High)**  
**Probability**: Medium - Multiple simultaneous sounds during intense gameplay  
**Impact**: High - Could break 60 FPS performance target  
**Mitigation**:
- Implement audio priority system (limit simultaneous sounds)
- Use audio buffer pooling pattern from particle system
- Add performance monitoring for audio processing
- Implement quality scaling for lower-end devices
**Testing Focus**: Performance testing with stress scenarios

### 3. PERF-002: Memory Leak from Audio Buffers
**Score: 6 (High)**  
**Probability**: High - Without proper cleanup, buffers accumulate  
**Impact**: Medium - Progressive performance degradation over time  
**Mitigation**:
- Implement AudioBufferPool similar to particle ObjectPool
- Proper cleanup in component unmount lifecycle
- Monitor memory usage in AudioMonitor
- Add automated memory leak detection tests
**Testing Focus**: Long-running memory profiling tests

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
*No critical risks - skip to Priority 2*

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
- **Browser Compatibility Suite**: Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, mobile browsers
- **Performance Stress Tests**: 
  - Spawn 50+ simultaneous sound effects
  - Monitor FPS during audio-heavy gameplay
  - Track CPU usage patterns
- **Memory Leak Tests**:
  - Run game for 30+ minutes continuously
  - Monitor heap allocation trends
  - Verify buffer cleanup on scene transitions

### Priority 3: Medium Risk Tests
- **Audio Context Recovery**: Test init failures and recovery
- **Asset Loading Tests**: Verify lazy loading and progress indicators
- **Format Compatibility**: Test various audio formats

### Priority 4: Low Risk Tests
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Verify silent mode works
- **Edge Cases**: Test with disabled audio hardware

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- All high risks must have implemented mitigations
- Performance must maintain 60 FPS with audio enabled
- Memory leaks must be eliminated

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- Medium risks with monitoring in place
- Browser compatibility with documented requirements
- Asset loading with progress indicators

### Accepted Risks
- Silent fallback for unsupported browsers (documented)
- Rare audio format incompatibilities (with fallbacks)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- **Performance Metrics**: Audio processing time, FPS impact
- **Memory Usage**: Heap allocation trends, buffer count
- **Error Rates**: Audio context failures, asset load failures
- **Browser Analytics**: Track unsupported browser usage

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- New audio features added (3D spatial audio, effects processing)
- Performance issues reported in production
- Browser API changes or deprecations
- Memory usage patterns change significantly
- User feedback indicates audio problems

## Recommendations

### Must Fix
1. Implement AudioBufferPool to prevent memory leaks
2. Add audio priority system to limit simultaneous sounds
3. Feature detection for Web Audio API support

### Should Monitor
1. Audio processing impact on frame rate
2. Memory usage trends during gameplay
3. Browser compatibility analytics
4. Audio asset loading times

### Nice to Have
1. Advanced audio compression for smaller assets
2. Adaptive quality based on device capabilities
3. Audio visualization for debugging

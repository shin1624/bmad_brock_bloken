## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
1. **Canvas Interaction Testing**
   - Verify Canvas element detection and interaction
   - Test coordinate-based paddle movement
   - Validate ball physics and collision detection
   - Ensure proper rendering of game elements

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement test parallelization
   - Create tiered test suites (smoke, regression, full)
   - Monitor and optimize individual test execution times
   - Set up performance baselines

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
1. **Cross-Browser Validation**
   - Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari
   - Document browser-specific behaviors
   - Create browser-specific test configurations

2. **Animation & Timing Tests**
   - Implement robust wait strategies
   - Test with animations disabled
   - Verify frame rate consistency

3. **Visual Regression Management**
   - Establish baseline management process
   - Implement selective visual testing
   - Version control screenshot baselines

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
1. **Security Testing**
   - Basic XSS prevention tests
   - Local storage security validation

2. **Memory Profiling**
   - Long-running test scenarios
   - Memory usage monitoring

3. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Viewport adaptation tests
   - Touch interaction validation

## Risk Mitigation Implementation Plan

### Immediate Actions (Before Development)
1. Set up Canvas testing utilities library
2. Configure Playwright for parallel execution
3. Establish visual regression baseline process
4. Create browser-specific test configurations

### During Development
1. Implement Page Object Models with Canvas helpers
2. Add wait strategies for animations
3. Create tiered test suites
4. Set up CI/CD integration with proper timeouts

### Post-Implementation
1. Monitor test execution metrics
2. Track flaky test patterns
3. Optimize slow-running tests
4. Maintain visual regression baselines

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- All critical risks must have mitigation implemented
- Test execution time must be <10 minutes
- Flaky test rate must be <1%
- Canvas interactions must work on all browsers

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- Visual regression with documented baseline update process
- Performance tests with known thresholds
- Security tests with compensating controls

### Accepted Risks
- Minor browser rendering differences (documented)
- Mobile viewport edge cases (with workarounds)
- Test data management complexity (with cleanup procedures)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- **Performance Metrics**: Test execution times, parallelization efficiency
- **Stability Metrics**: Flaky test rate, false positive rate
- **Coverage Metrics**: User flow coverage, browser coverage
- **Maintenance Metrics**: Baseline update frequency, test update effort

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- New browser versions released
- Canvas API changes introduced
- Test execution time exceeds threshold
- Flaky test rate increases above 1%
- Major UI redesign implemented
- New game features added

## Recommendations for Test Coverage

### Critical Coverage Areas (Must Have)
1. **Canvas Gameplay**: 100% coverage of core game mechanics

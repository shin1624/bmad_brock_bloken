## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. TECH-001: ProjectileSystem Architecture Complexity

**Score: 9 (Critical)**  
**Category**: Technical  
**Probability**: High (3) - Brand new system with no existing patterns  
**Impact**: High (3) - Affects game loop, collision detection, rendering pipeline

**Description**:
ProjectileSystem is a completely new subsystem that must integrate with:
- Game update loop timing
- Collision detection system
- Rendering layer (between balls and particles)
- Object pooling infrastructure

Design flaws will cascade through the entire architecture and be expensive to refactor.

**Affected Components**:
- `src/game/systems/ProjectileSystem.ts` (new)
- `src/game/entities/Projectile.ts` (new)
- `src/game/utils/ProjectilePool.ts` (new)
- `src/game/core/GameLoop.ts` (modified)
- `src/game/physics/CollisionDetector.ts` (modified)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **BLOCKER**: Complete and approve ProjectileSystem design document before coding
2. Build isolated prototype to validate design decisions
3. Define clear interfaces with existing systems
4. Implement comprehensive unit tests for ProjectileSystem in isolation
5. Integration tests with existing collision/rendering systems

**Testing Requirements**:
- Unit tests: ProjectileSystem standalone functionality (90% coverage)
- Integration tests: Collision detection with blocks
- Integration tests: Render layer ordering
- Performance tests: 20 active projectiles with object pooling
- Memory leak tests: Long-running projectile creation/destruction

**Residual Risk**: Medium - Even with good design, integration bugs are likely  
**Owner**: Dev Team + Architect  
**Timeline**: Before Story 4.3b development starts

### 2. PERF-001: Slow Motion + Multi-ball Performance Degradation

**Score: 9 (Critical)**  
**Category**: Performance  
**Probability**: High (3) - Multiple balls with time-scaled physics  
**Impact**: High (3) - FPS drop below 55 renders game unplayable

**Description**:
Slow Motion affects all entities except paddle. With Multi-ball active (3+ balls), each ball requires:
- Independent time-scaled velocity calculations
- Time-scaled collision detection
- Coordinated deltaTime propagation

This creates O(n) complexity for physics updates where n = number of balls.

**Affected Components**:
- `src/game/plugins/powerups/SlowMotionPowerUp.ts`
- `src/game/core/GameLoop.ts` (deltaTime modification)
- `src/game/physics/PhysicsSystem.ts`
- `src/game/entities/Ball.ts`

**Performance Targets**:
- **Required**: 55 FPS with 3 balls + Slow Motion
- **Desired**: 60 FPS with 3 balls + Slow Motion

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Early performance profiling with Chrome DevTools
2. Implement quality settings (low/medium/high effects)
3. Optimize time scale calculations (pre-compute scaled deltaTime)
4. Use object pooling for all effects
5. Render batching for similar visual effects
6. Conditional updates (skip inactive systems)

**Testing Requirements**:
- Performance benchmark: 3 balls + Slow Motion → measure FPS
- Performance benchmark: 5 advanced power-ups + 3 balls → measure FPS
- Memory profiling: Ensure <250MB during gameplay
- Load test: 60-second gameplay with worst-case scenario

**Residual Risk**: Medium - May need to reduce effect quality or limit ball count  
**Owner**: Dev Team  
**Timeline**: Implement during Story 4.3b, validate before QA gate

## High Risks

### 3. TECH-002: Time Scale Implementation Complexity

**Score: 6 (High)**  
**Category**: Technical  
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Affects entire game loop  
**Impact**: High (3) - Incorrect implementation ruins game feel

**Description**:
Time scaling requires careful deltaTime propagation through:
- Game loop update cycle
- Physics system calculations
- Entity movement updates
- Effect duration tracking
- Paddle must remain at normal speed (exception case)

Poor implementation causes:
- Jittery movement
- Inconsistent game feel
- Audio/visual desynchronization

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Clear deltaTime flow architecture
2. Paddle exception handling in physics system
3. Smooth transition implementation (0.5s ramp up/down)
4. Extensive playtesting for game feel
5. Time scale unit tests with mock entities

**Testing Requirements**:
- Unit tests: deltaTime scaling calculations
- Integration tests: Paddle moves at normal speed during Slow Motion
- Integration tests: Balls move at 50% speed during Slow Motion
- Manual testing: Game feel validation

**Residual Risk**: Low - Well-understood pattern if implemented carefully  
**Owner**: Dev Team

### 4. PERF-002: Five Simultaneous Power-ups

**Score: 6 (High)**  
**Category**: Performance  
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Edge case but possible  
**Impact**: High (3) - 50 FPS minimum requirement

**Description**:
All 5 advanced power-ups active simultaneously:
1. Shield (visual barrier effect)
2. Pierce Ball (trail effect)
3. Magnet Paddle (glow effect)
4. Slow Motion (screen distortion)
5. Laser Gun (beam effects + projectiles)

Combined rendering and update load may exceed performance budget.

**Performance Target**: 50 FPS with all 5 active

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Effect pooling (reuse visual objects)
2. Render batching (group similar draws)
3. LOD system (reduce effect quality under load)
4. Adaptive quality settings
5. Profiling-driven optimization

**Testing Requirements**:
- Performance test: All 5 power-ups active → measure FPS
- Memory test: Ensure <250MB with all 5 active
- Visual test: Ensure effects remain distinct even at low quality

**Residual Risk**: Medium - May need quality reduction  
**Owner**: Dev Team

---

### 5. DATA-001: Memory Leak in ProjectilePool

**Score: 6 (High)**  
**Category**: Data/Memory  
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Object pooling bugs are common  
**Impact**: High (3) - Memory leak causes crash during extended play

**Description**:
ProjectilePool manages 20 projectile objects with recycling. Common failure modes:
- Projectiles not returned to pool
- References held after cleanup
- Pool size grows unbounded
- Off-screen projectiles not cleaned up

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Strict pool management with clear acquire/release patterns
2. Automatic cleanup for off-screen projectiles
3. Memory usage monitoring (alert at >250MB)
4. Defensive programming with object validation
5. Comprehensive pool unit tests

**Testing Requirements**:
- Unit tests: Pool acquire/release cycles
- Unit tests: Automatic cleanup triggers
- Integration tests: Long-running gameplay (5+ minutes)
- Memory profiling: Track projectile count and memory usage
- Leak detection tests: Create/destroy 1000 projectiles

**Residual Risk**: Low - Well-tested pooling pattern exists  
**Owner**: Dev Team

## Medium Risks

### 6. TECH-003: Laser + Multi-ball Integration

**Score: 4 (Medium)**  
**Category**: Technical  
**Probability**: Medium (2)  
**Impact**: Medium (2)

**Description**:
Laser projectiles must operate independently of ball physics. Potential issues:
- Laser collision interferes with ball collision
- Laser firing affects ball trajectory
- Visual confusion between lasers and balls

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Separate collision detection for projectiles
2. Clear visual distinction (red lasers vs colored balls)
3. Independent update cycles
4. Integration tests for simultaneous operation

**Testing Requirements**:
- Integration test: Laser + Multi-ball both active
- Visual test: Clear distinction between lasers and balls
- Collision test: No interference between systems

**Residual Risk**: Low  
**Owner**: Dev Team

## Low Risks

### 7. OPS-001: Regression in Phase 1 Power-ups

**Score: 3 (Low)**  
**Category**: Operational  
**Probability**: Low (1) - Plugin architecture provides isolation  
**Impact**: High (3) - Breaking existing features is unacceptable

**Description**:
Phase 2 changes to GameState, GameLoop, or shared systems could break Phase 1 power-ups:
- Shield protection mechanism
- Pierce ball behavior
- Magnet paddle attachment

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Comprehensive Phase 1 regression test suite
2. No modifications to Phase 1 plugin files
3. Additive changes only to shared systems
4. Pre-deployment regression testing

**Testing Requirements**:
- Regression suite: All Phase 1 power-up tests
- Integration test: Phase 1 + Phase 2 combinations
- Manual testing: All power-up interactions

**Residual Risk**: Minimal  
**Owner**: QA Team

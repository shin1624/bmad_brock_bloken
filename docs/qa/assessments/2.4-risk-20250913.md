# Risk Profile Assessment: Story 2.4 - 衝突検出システム

**Assessment Date**: 2025-09-13  
**Assessed By**: Quinn (Test Architect)  
**Risk Level**: HIGH  
**Overall Risk Score**: 56/100

## Executive Summary

Story 2.4 demonstrates proper TDD methodology with 8/8 tests passing, but contains critical implementation gaps that pose significant risks to game physics functionality. While the basic acceptance criteria are nominally addressed, the implementations are minimal stubs lacking the depth required for production collision detection systems.

## Risk Matrix Analysis

### Critical Risks (Impact: 8-10, Probability: 7-10)

**None identified** - No complete system failures expected

### High Risks (Impact: 6-8, Probability: 5-8)

1. **Physics System Integration Failure**
   - **Probability**: 8/10
   - **Impact**: 7/10
   - **Risk Score**: 56/100
   - **Description**: Minimal stub implementations may fail when integrated with actual game physics, causing ball tunneling, incorrect collision responses, and gameplay disruption
   - **Mitigation**: Complete implementation of spatial partitioning and collision algorithms before integration

2. **Performance Degradation**
   - **Probability**: 7/10  
   - **Impact**: 6/10
   - **Risk Score**: 42/100
   - **Description**: Missing O(n²) → O(n) optimization means collision detection may not maintain 60FPS under load
   - **Mitigation**: Implement actual spatial partitioning algorithm with performance benchmarks

3. **Development Technical Debt**
   - **Probability**: 9/10
   - **Impact**: 5/10
   - **Risk Score**: 45/100
   - **Description**: Hard-coded values and stub implementations create maintenance burden and may cause confusion for future developers
   - **Mitigation**: Complete implementations and add proper documentation

### Medium Risks (Impact: 4-6, Probability: 5-7)

1. **Missing Feature Integration**
   - **Probability**: 6/10
   - **Impact**: 5/10
   - **Risk Score**: 30/100
   - **Description**: Block destruction integration (AC3) not implemented, may require significant rework
   - **Mitigation**: Connect collision detection with existing block system

2. **Debug/Testing Limitations**
   - **Probability**: 7/10
   - **Impact**: 4/10
   - **Risk Score**: 28/100
   - **Description**: Minimal debugging capabilities may slow future collision system development and issue resolution
   - **Mitigation**: Implement visual debugging tools and comprehensive test coverage

### Low Risks (Impact: 1-3, Probability: 1-4)

**None identified** - No minor risks warrant documentation

## Risk Trend Analysis

**Increasing Risks:**
- Technical debt accumulation if implementations not completed
- Integration complexity as other stories depend on collision system
- Performance issues may compound as game complexity increases

**Stable Risks:**
- Security concerns remain minimal (pure mathematical computation)
- Basic test structure provides foundation for expansion

## Recommendations by Priority

### Must Fix (Critical Path)
1. **Complete SpatialGrid Implementation** - Implement actual spatial partitioning algorithm
2. **EventBus Integration** - Connect collision events with system architecture
3. **Performance Validation** - Add benchmarks to validate optimization claims

### Should Address (Important)
1. **Block Destruction Integration** - Complete AC3 requirements
2. **CollisionDebugger Enhancement** - Add actual debugging capabilities
3. **Integration Testing** - Create multi-system collision test scenarios

### Could Address (Nice-to-Have)
1. **Advanced CCD Algorithms** - For high-speed collision scenarios
2. **Configurable Performance Levels** - For different hardware capabilities
3. **Visual Debugging Tools** - For development and troubleshooting

## Risk Monitoring Plan

**Weekly Reviews**: Monitor implementation completion progress
**Integration Testing**: Validate collision system with broader game engine
**Performance Benchmarking**: Establish baseline measurements for optimization validation
**Technical Debt Tracking**: Measure completion of stub implementations

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

**Risk Acceptable When:**
- Spatial partitioning algorithm implemented and tested
- EventBus integration complete with collision event handling
- Performance benchmarks demonstrate <5ms collision detection processing time
- At least 4/5 acceptance criteria fully implemented (not stubs)

**Risk Escalation Triggers:**
- Any integration failures with existing physics system
- Performance degradation below 60FPS during collision-heavy scenarios
- Additional stories blocked waiting for collision system completion

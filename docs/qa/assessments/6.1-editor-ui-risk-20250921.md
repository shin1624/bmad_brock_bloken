Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 12
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 4
- Risk Score: 72/100 (Moderate-High Risk)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. PERF-001: Canvas Rendering Performance with Large Grids
**Score: 9 (Critical)**  
**Probability**: High - Large levels will stress rendering  
**Impact**: Critical - Editor becomes unusable if FPS drops below 30  
**Mitigation**:
- Implement virtual scrolling for grid viewport
- Use dirty rectangle optimization for partial redraws
- Batch render operations
- Add performance monitoring from start
**Testing Focus**: Stress test with maximum grid size (100x100 blocks)

## High Risks Requiring Mitigation

### 2. UX-001: Drag-and-Drop Cross-Browser Compatibility
**Score: 6 (High)**  
**Probability**: High - Different browsers handle drag events differently  
**Impact**: Medium - Core functionality broken on some browsers  
**Mitigation**:
- Use established drag-drop library (react-dnd)
- Implement fallback tap-to-place interface
- Test on all major browsers early
- Add polyfills where needed
**Testing Focus**: Cross-browser testing matrix (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### 3. UX-002: Mobile/Touch Device Usability
**Score: 6 (High)**  
**Probability**: High - Touch interactions differ from mouse  
**Impact**: Medium - Poor mobile experience  
**Mitigation**:
- Design mobile-first touch interface
- Larger touch targets for mobile
- Alternative interaction patterns for touch
- Responsive UI layout
**Testing Focus**: Touch device testing on various screen sizes

### 4. STATE-001: Undo/Redo History Memory Growth
**Score: 6 (High)**  
**Probability**: Medium - Long editing sessions accumulate history  
**Impact**: High - Memory exhaustion crashes browser  
**Mitigation**:
- Implement history size limit (max 50 actions)
- Use command pattern with lightweight action objects
- Add memory usage monitoring
- Compress or serialize old history entries
**Testing Focus**: Long-duration editing sessions with monitoring

### 5. DATA-001: State Loss on Browser Refresh
**Score: 6 (High)**  
**Probability**: High - Users will accidentally refresh  
**Impact**: Medium - Loss of unsaved work  
**Mitigation**:
- Auto-save to localStorage periodically
- Warn on navigation with unsaved changes
- Implement recovery from localStorage
- Add explicit save functionality
**Testing Focus**: Browser navigation and refresh scenarios

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
- **Performance Stress Tests**:
  - Create 100x100 grid with all blocks
  - Measure FPS during continuous drag operations
  - Monitor memory usage over time
  - Test scroll performance with large grids

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility Suite**:
  - Test drag-drop on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
  - Verify touch events on mobile browsers
  - Test fallback interfaces
  
- **State Management Tests**:
  - Execute 100+ undo/redo operations
  - Test browser refresh at various states
  - Verify auto-save functionality
  - Test recovery from localStorage

- **Mobile Usability Tests**:
  - Test on iOS and Android devices
  - Various screen sizes (phone, tablet)
  - Touch gesture recognition
  - Responsive layout verification

### Priority 3: Medium Risk Tests
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Canvas-React synchronization
  - Grid snapping accuracy
  - Preview mode rendering
  - State consistency checks

### Priority 4: Low Risk Tests
- **Accessibility Tests**:
  - Keyboard navigation flow
  - Screen reader compatibility
  - Focus management
  - ARIA labels

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- Canvas performance must maintain 30+ FPS minimum
- Core drag-drop must work on major browsers
- Undo/redo must not cause memory leaks
- Auto-save must prevent data loss

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- Mobile experience can be enhanced post-MVP
- Advanced keyboard shortcuts can be added later
- Performance optimization can be iterative
- Accessibility improvements can be phased

### Accepted Risks
- Complex UI learning curve (provide documentation)
- Preview minor inaccuracies (document limitations)
- Edge browser compatibility issues (document requirements)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- **Performance Metrics**: FPS, render time, memory usage
- **User Behavior**: Common error patterns, feature usage
- **Error Rates**: Failed saves, state corruption, crashes
- **Browser Analytics**: Browser/device distribution

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Performance issues reported by users
- New browser versions released
- Mobile usage patterns change
- Memory issues identified in production
- State corruption bugs reported

## Recommendations

### Must Implement
1. Virtual scrolling for large grids from day one
2. Use established drag-drop library (react-dnd)
3. Implement auto-save with localStorage
4. Add performance monitoring hooks
5. Create mobile touch interface variant

### Should Monitor
1. Canvas rendering performance metrics
2. Memory usage during long sessions
3. Browser/device usage analytics
4. Error rates and patterns

### Nice to Have
1. Advanced performance optimizations
2. Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts
3. Tutorial system for new users
4. Offline mode with sync

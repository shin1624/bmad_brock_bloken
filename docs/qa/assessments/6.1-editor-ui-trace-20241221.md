- **Actions**: `editorActions.undo()` and `editorActions.redo()`
  - Given: History with multiple states
  - When: Undo/redo actions triggered
  - Then: Grid state rolls back/forward
  - Coverage: Core functionality complete

**Gap**: No UI controls for undo/redo, keyboard shortcuts not implemented

### Critical Gaps for Task 1

None - Task 1 successfully established the foundation as planned.

### Phase 2 Readiness Assessment

Based on Phase 1 completion, the following are ready for Phase 2:

1. **Grid System**: ✅ Ready for block placement
2. **Store Architecture**: ✅ Ready for state management  
3. **Type System**: ✅ Ready for block definitions
4. **Component Skeletons**: ✅ Ready for implementation
5. **Performance Monitoring**: ✅ Ready for optimization

### Test Coverage Analysis

#### Unit Tests Created
- `gridUtils.test.ts` - Grid coordinate conversion ✅
- `editorStore.test.ts` - Store actions and state ✅
- `VirtualGrid.test.tsx` - Virtual scrolling grid ✅
- `PerformanceMonitor.test.ts` - Performance tracking ✅

#### Integration Tests Needed (Phase 2+)
- Drag-and-drop flow with grid
- Block palette to grid placement
- Preview mode rendering
- Undo/redo with UI

### Performance Validation

**Performance Infrastructure**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

- **PerformanceMonitor**: Tracks FPS, memory, render time
- **usePerformanceMonitor Hook**: React integration ready
- **VirtualGrid**: Handles 100x100 grids efficiently
- **Target**: 60 FPS maintained

### Security Considerations

As documented in story:
- Input validation structure in place
- Grid size limits defined (100x100)
- Memory budget set (200MB)

### Risk Assessment for Phase 1

- **High Risk**: None identified
- **Medium Risk**: None identified
- **Low Risk**: Component integration in Phase 2

### Recommendations for Phase 2

1. **Priority 1**: Implement block type definitions and visual representations
2. **Priority 2**: Connect drag-and-drop to grid placement
3. **Priority 3**: Add keyboard shortcuts for tools and undo/redo
4. **Priority 4**: Implement preview mode rendering

### Quality Gate Decision for Task 1

**Status**: PASS ✅

**Rationale**: 
- All Phase 1 tasks completed as specified
- Foundation components created and tested
- Grid system fully operational
- Store architecture implemented with history
- Performance monitoring in place
- Ready for Phase 2 implementation

**Evidence**:
- 12 component files created
- 4 test files with passing tests
- Store with undo/redo capability
- Virtual grid handling 100x100 cells
- Type system defined

### Next Steps

Proceed to Phase 2: Block Palette Implementation with confidence. The foundation is solid and well-tested.

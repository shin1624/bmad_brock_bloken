## Technical Scope

### Testing Pyramid Implementation
```
         /\
        /E2E\      10% - User journey validation
       /------\    Tool: Playwright
      / Integ \    30% - Component integration
     /----------\  Tool: React Testing Library  
    /Unit Tests  \ 60% - Logic validation

## Architecture Decisions

### Test Infrastructure

**Directory Structure**:
```
tests/
├── unit/               # Unit test specs
├── integration/        # Integration test specs
├── e2e/               # E2E test specs
├── fixtures/          # Test data fixtures
├── mocks/            # Mock implementations
├── utils/            # Test utilities
└── coverage/         # Coverage reports
```

**Technology Stack**:
- **Unit/Integration**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **E2E**: Playwright
- **Coverage**: V8 Coverage Provider
- **Assertions**: Vitest built-in matchers
- **Mocking**: Vitest vi.mock
- **Reporting**: HTML, LCOV, JSON formats

### Testing Standards

**Naming Conventions**:
```typescript
// Test files: ComponentName.test.ts
// Test suites: describe('ComponentName')
// Test cases: it('should [expected behavior] when [condition]')
```

**Test Structure**:
```typescript
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  // Setup
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Arrange common test data
  });
  
  // Teardown
  afterEach(() => {
    // Clean up
  });
  
  describe('methodName', () => {
    it('should handle success case', () => {
      // Arrange
      // Act
      // Assert
    });
    
    it('should handle error case', () => {
      // Arrange
      // Act
      // Assert
    });
  });
});
```

### Continuous Integration

**CI Pipeline**:
```yaml
test-pipeline:
  - stage: lint
    script: npm run lint
  
  - stage: unit-tests
    script: npm run test:unit
    coverage: true
    
  - stage: integration-tests
    script: npm run test:integration
    
  - stage: e2e-tests
    script: npm run test:e2e
    browsers: [chrome, firefox, safari]
    
  - stage: coverage-report
    script: npm run coverage:report
    threshold: 90%
```

**Quality Gates**:
- All tests must pass
- Coverage must meet thresholds
- No new lint errors
- Performance benchmarks met

2. Level progression (1 → 2 → 3)
3. Power-up collection and activation
4. High score recording and display
5. Settings change and persistence
6. Level editor create → save → load → play

**Cross-browser Testing Matrix**:
| Browser | Versions | Priority |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Chrome | Latest, Latest-1 | P0 |
| Firefox | Latest, Latest-1 | P0 |
| Safari | Latest | P1 |
| Edge | Latest | P2 |
| Mobile Safari | iOS 15+ | P2 |
| Chrome Mobile | Android 10+ | P2 |

### Performance Testing

**Benchmarks**:
- Game maintains 60 FPS (95th percentile)
- Input latency < 16ms
- Memory usage < 200MB
- Load time < 3 seconds
- No memory leaks over 1 hour play

**Load Testing**:
- 1000 blocks on screen
- 10 simultaneous particle effects
- Rapid input sequences
- Extended play sessions

## Documentation Requirements

### Test Documentation
- Test plan document
- Test case specifications
- Coverage report interpretation
- Debugging guide
- Mock data documentation

### Developer Guides
- "How to write tests" guide
- Test patterns and anti-patterns
- Debugging test failures
- Coverage improvement strategies
- CI/CD integration guide

## Notes

### Best Practices
- Write tests first (TDD) for new features
- One assertion per test when possible
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Keep tests independent and idempotent
- Use meaningful test descriptions

### Anti-patterns to Avoid
- Testing private methods directly
- Over-mocking (test real logic when possible)
- Shared state between tests
- Time-dependent tests without proper mocking
- Testing third-party library internals
